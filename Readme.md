CSS
1. I learned how to use CSS Variables â€” defining them using --variable-name and accessing them using var(--variable-name).
2. I understood the importance of the overflow property (like overflow: auto, scroll, etc.), and that it only works correctly when a height or max-height is set on the element.

JAVASCRIPT
1. I learned how to use the setAttribute() method to dynamically set attributes on elements.
Example: element.setAttribute("class", "active");
2. I learned how to access child elements of a DOM element using the .children property.
Example:element.children[0] gives the first child.
3. I learned how to remove all existing classes from an element without mentioning them individually by using:
element.className = "";
4. I explored the use of event.target (evt.target) to find the exact element that triggered an event, which is useful for event delegation and customizing actions based on what was clicked.
